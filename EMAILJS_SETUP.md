# EmailJS Configuration Guide

## Problem
The website is displaying errors related to EmailJS configuration, specifically:
```
Public Key from env: NOT SET
⚠️ EmailJS not configured - emails will not be sent
```

## Solution
Follow these steps to properly configure EmailJS:

1. **Get your EmailJS Public Key**:
   - Go to [EmailJS Dashboard](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/account)
   - Copy your **Public Key** from the Account page (this is different from your User ID)

2. **Update .env file**:
   - Open the `.env` file in the root of your project
   - Add or replace the following lines:
   ```
   VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_actual_public_key_here
   VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_uehk5ke
   VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_oqhdtrr
   ```
   - Make sure the public key is complete (should be around 20-30 characters)
   - The current key fragment appears incomplete

3. **Restart your development server**:
   - After updating the .env file, stop and restart your development server
   - This is necessary for environment variables to be reloaded

4. **Verify the configuration**:
   - Open the browser console
   - You should see a message: "✅ EmailJS initialized successfully"
   - Test the contact form to ensure emails are being sent properly

## Troubleshooting
- If the error persists, check that:
  - The `.env` file is in the root directory of your project
  - There are no typos in `VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY`
  - You're using the Public Key, not the User ID or Service ID
  - Your development server was restarted after making changes

## Additional Resources
- Use the EmailJS Tester component added to `/src/components/admin/EmailJSTester.tsx`
- This component can help diagnose issues with your EmailJS configuration
- You can incorporate it into an admin page for testing
